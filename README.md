# Bamazon
----
### An e-commerce simulation application.
----
#### Technologies used include JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, Color NPM, Inquirer NPM and Console.Table NPM.
### Customer Interface
For this project, I built a back-end application which simulates an e-commerce website. The user interfaces with the program via the terminal, using npm inquirer. The Customer is prompted to vew items, choose an item, choose a quantity, checkout, continue to shop or exit. During this interaction, the database of items is updated to reflect any purchases.

### Manager Interface
This application also includes an administrative program for the user to view all inventory, view low inventory, add inventory and add new items to the database.
